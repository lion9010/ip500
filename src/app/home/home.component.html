                    The IP500® Alliance is an open and international association. It has been formed by OEMs and system
                    manufacturers to establish a standardized and reliable open meshed wireless sensor and actuator
                    network –
                    mainly for large commercial and enterprise building and process automation applications.

                    As an open, non-proprietary, high-performance, and secure building automation platform the
                    IP500&reg;
                    standard does indeed set new standards. It is the only wireless technology standard to ensure
                    maximum
                    interoperability by using and supporting the main industry norms and by clearly specifying all
                    interfaces.

                <p>
                    IP500&reg; solutions ensure robust, uninterruptible, wireless communication between
                    security-relevant
                    building automation components. The IP500&reg; standard ensures the requisite cross-disciplinary
                    interoperability that is, moreover, easy to implement using the BACnet and IP500&reg;
                    interoperability
                    specifications.

            &quot;The IP500 standar solution will allow OEMs to enable business oportunities in a real project, where
            interoperation of various smart devices is the key. Until today, OEMs are struggling with their own
            proprietary low power network solution on one side and on the other currently available standard solutions
            are not providing the right performance. <br> Due to the IP based connectibity approach and the secod source
            strategy of the IP500 Alliance, OEMs will have more freedom and oportunities for their vusiness
            approach&quot;
