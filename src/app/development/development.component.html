        The CNX – IP500® Development Kit R3 provides all that is needed for System Developers to integrate their Smart
        Building products into an IP500® network. Learn how easy it is to control and communicate with sensors and
        actors via a graphical web interface. In less than 10 minutes you can have a full-functioned demo IP500® network
        set up in your environment. Simply power on the Netbook, place the DK boards and power them on, and in a few
        moments, you can try out the board features. The CNX100 module mounted on the full-featured Development Boards
        provides the basis for rolling out an IP500® network. A Development Demo is provided as a framework for building
        your own applications for your own IP500® compliant devices.</p>
